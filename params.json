{"name":"Philips Hue SDK iOS/OSX","tagline":"The Software Development Kit for Philips Hue on iOS and OSX","body":"### Introduction to the iOS/OSX SDK.\r\nThe iOS/OSX Hue SDK is a set of tools that are designed to make it easy to access the Hue system through the Hue Wi-Fi network connected bridge and control an associated set of connected lamps. The aim of the SDK is to enable you to create your own applications for the Hue system. The tools are provided with documentation for the SDK and example code.   \r\n   \r\n      \r\nTo develop for Hue you require the Philips Hue Personal Wireless Lighting System.\r\n\r\n### Example Source Code\r\nThere are currently 3 sample apps with source code, which demonstrate how to use the SDK:\r\n\r\n* **Quick Start App iOS**  A bare bones iOS app with minimal code for connecting to a bridge. A good starting point for creating your own hue app.\r\n* **Quick Start App OSX**  A bare bones OSX app with minimal code for connecting to a bridge. A good starting point for creating your own hue app.\r\n* **Sample App**       A larger example iOS app showing more functionality\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nFor an explanation of the key concepts and how to use the SDK, please refer to the README.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PhilipsHue/PhilipsHueSDK-iOS-OSX/blob/master/README.md\r\n\r\nFor further developer information please visit:\r\n\r\nhttp://developers.meethue.com \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble developing for Hue?
